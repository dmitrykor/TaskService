# Task service
The service is a Spring Boot application. For assumptions, details of the design and implementation please refer to the TaskService.docx file.

To run any api user authentication is required. There are 3 predefined users which you can use (listed in the doc file.)

Unit testing is limited to integration test of the REST api in the Spring way. Given the size of the project that seemed reasonably enough.
